Wohooo... What a year... AI, EV, Wars, Scandals and so on. But, Obviously not for traditional media.

Elon Musk has ignited a conversation about the current status of traditional media and as you guys already know he's not a biggest fan of them. But, tweets contain 2 charts which clearly shows that media giants Bloomberg and WSJ clearly losing their organic traffic. After the invention of world wide web, they were obviously losing their power however it's evident that we're passing a critical threshold here.

But, is it really a good thing? Obviously, Internet is the great equalizer. But, it's also a place where millions of people who claim to have the truth share their opinions which are mostly crafted through their biases, beliefs and subjective experiences. It's overwhelming to keep up with it. And, not interestingly, the social media is designed to keep you engaged which actually favors the most entertaining and controversial content rather than the most truthful one.

Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying traditional journalism should come back. But, I think we should be more cautious about how journalism will look like in the future and how we can make it better, in which I don't have slightest idea.
