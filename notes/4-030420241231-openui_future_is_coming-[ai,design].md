Just had a chance to play with OpenUI's new toy. It's basically LLM engine to build UI's step by step with prompt engineering. For a long time we were having discussions around how AI based tools might impact our future. Debates got heated and divided people into two camps. One camp was saying that AI can't do what software engineers do, such as architecting, tech-debt & complexity management, code reviews, performance optimizations, dependency analysis etc.

But, most of these people are missing a key point which is that the change will be huge it'll change all domain language we're using. Basically the question here is define tech-debt & complexity in ai world.

There's a mantra says that [**code is read more than written**](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/835238-indeed-the-ratio-of-time-spent-reading-versus-writing-is). That's true in a world where most of the code is written and reviewed by humans. But, do we really think it'll be same in AI based software engineering? I don't think so. 

Architecture, complexity, code reviews are human construct. They're not universal facts that machine can operate on. They're based on human experiences. And, as we know, AI can't experience. It can only learn from data.

So, long story short, I think we're at the brink of a new era where everybody will become prompt engineer including designers, product managers, people managers and obviously engineers. It's an exciting age to be in.
