Pair-programming is a common practice across the software industry. At first look, it seems like it's doubling the effort and halving the productivity. But, studies shows that it actually adds up 15% to development time while resulting in %15 less error. Some people compares it to having 2 pilots in cockpit. Where second pilot is there to monitor flight and ready to take over.

[Studies](https://www.gitclear.com/coding_on_copilot_data_shows_ais_downward_pressure_on_code_quality) shows that Since 2022 copy-pasting is on rise. Another study found out that codegen tools deliver code that is valid about 90% of the time, passes 60% of unit tests, and is secure about 60%. 

Long story short: AI job is to be fast while yours is to be good. Someone still needs to provide guardrails for the code generated. 

On the other hand, it reminds me ["ironies of automation"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0005109883900468) research paper where it's stated that as automation increases, human's role becomes more crucial in different ways.

First, human needs to monitor the system automated in our case it's the codegen tool we're utilising. To do so, somebody needs to understand what would be the desired output. And, it's not that easy. It requires an experienced pair of eyes to judge whether the code generated is valid, secure and maintainable.

Second, skills that are not used are deteoriated. So, particularly in our case experienced engineers are in danger of losing their sharpness as they stop thinking about structured problem solving and delegating it to the AI. It applies to junior developers as well. As we all know it, coding is learned by practicing. During the programming, programmers reason about structures, recognized patterns and applies techniques to solve the problem elegantly. How junior engineers will understand validity, quality and security of the code generated if they don't practice it?

So, I think in a few years codegen tools will become unreplacable part of our daily routine. But, they're not silver bullets and kind of far away from replacing software engineers as of now - Although I believe we'll be replaced in 5-10 year scale. Therefore, my suggestion in this transition period to developers, don't let it to deteriorate your skills. And, keep practicing until you master it.
