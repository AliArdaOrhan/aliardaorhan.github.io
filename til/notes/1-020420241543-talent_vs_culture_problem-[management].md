After 12 years of software engineering, including 6 years of team management experience, I came to conclusion that modern management theory doesn't work. Most of those principles, techniques and frameworks hit the wall when there's a information asymmetry between you and your peers. Most of the people are driven by their biases, perspectives and perceptions rather than data. Here are some of my observations:

- Happiness and performance is negatively correlated in most cases. I've never seen a team that is highly efficient and happy at the same time. When I say highly efficient, I'm not talkin about producing more work. I'm talking about producing more with higher quality. 
- Only way to have a happy and performative team is finding the right people who become happy as they become more productive. These people are rare and if you're mediocere company, the chances you find them are very very low.
- Even if you find some, because surrounding culture doesn't appropriate the same characteristics, they'll be extremely unhappy. In worse cases, they'll be problematic as they can't fit into the company.
- Most of the hiring managers becomes very happy whenever they encounter these rare breeds. But most of those managers are not equipped well to manage these people. They're driven by their biases, perspectives and perceptions. They're not interested in data. They're interested in their opinions.
- Especially, it become more problematic when most of those managers starts to feel incompetent and gets into some sort of competition with those people. Interestingly, they always do. Most common tactic is using other peoples opinions about these talents to oppress them and play some sort of power game. 
- These eyes saw extremely productive people put in PIP programs because they don't give answers others like. They're accused to be aggresive, uncollaborative, uncommunicative etc.
- As a result, it ends up with a disaster. These people are either fired or they leave the company. 

All of this brings us a siatution where I think modern management practices fails. Because, it doesn't deliver the basic premise of it, which is as you get those principles, you'll get better results. But, in reality it actually ends up in personal tragedy where you think you're doing correct thing, while others try to persuade you that you're actually wrong.

But, let me be honest, I think most of the companies around the world are in this situation. They're valuing artificial harmony over productive conflicts. The peter principle is usually the case. Good engineers became managers without necessary skillset and causes good talents to be oppressed. 

Some might argue that not every company is a good company. But, the biggest problem about it is basically these priciples are not applicable. It ends up with worse results rather than better ones. At the end we left with mediocre talents working for mediocre companies where people protect their turf rather than working for a common goal.
