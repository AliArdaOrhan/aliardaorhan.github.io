After Facebook bought Oculus 10 years ago, they're having challenges to make AR/VR technology mainstream. There's lack of content and shortcomings of hardware but Meta is progressing.

Interestinly, Fitness is one of the selling point of oculus VR. But, it's contradicting with gaming. Because, you need to take different parameters into consideration if you're building a game or a fitness app. such as temperature, sweating etc.

Another challenge is controller part. If you're interacting with AR/VR world, you have couple of options such as voice commands, hand gestures and controllers. But, voice commands doesn't present best user experience. It's hard to navigate any UI with your voice. Therefore, Facebook is focusing on controllers which is a novel problem space which we haven't seen since XEROX PARC.

In terms of content, contrary to Rayban, Meta is focusing on shareability rather than spatial video, in short high-quality experiences are not first priority. Although AI wearables like Humane AI PIN and Rabbit R1 are adding more Gen-AI features into their tools, Meta doesn't have a clear plan for this year. However, they see Gen-AI as a solution to the challenges of creation of metaverse where users can describe their desired space and Ai can create for them.

Although Meta's promises are not materialized yet, there's significant progress is going on. And, competition is getting fierce. There're important companies such as Apple are working on this space as well. And, after billions of invesments I just don't want to see Zuckerberg to fail.
