Ay yay yaaa!!! Elon's new toy... Robotaxi will unveil itself around August. And, it won't have any steering wheel or pedals. Cool, innit? 

Although, we haven't seen how Tesla will go around the legal requirements. It's kinda big concern as we haven't see any paperwork done yet. Nevertheless, big step for the industry and for high-tech revolution.
