I've come across an HR tool called HireVue, which uses AI to analyze video interviews. It's designed to address the first screening interview and provides you with 4-5 different behavioral questions, asking you to record your answers. Then, it analyzes your answers and gives you a score.

The selling point is that it saves time for HR departments and provides a more objective evaluation. On the other hand, people are frustrated by it, and a couple of Reddit and Quora discussions show that it tends to be found uncomfortable, dystopian, and dehumanizing. [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/ycxn19/anyone_ever_did_a_video_interview_with_hirevue/) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/kd1q4w/fuck_hirevue_and_any_company_that_makes/) [3](https://www.quora.com/HireVue-offends-me-Am-I-officially-an-old-dog)

I have mixed feelings about it. As a firm believer in AI-based systems, I see it as a huge step in empowering us with AI-based solutions and always think that data beats opinion. Additionally, I find the bias problem addressable to some extent with tweaking the parameters that model is using.

On the other hand, accusing models of having bias while ignoring human biases, perspectives, and perceptions seems unfair to technologists. I sincerely believe that even if models have biases, they'll outperform any human being. Therefore, these kinds of explosive comments started making me think that people are missing the point. Humans are not perfect at all... **And machines can help us.**

So, long story short, in an environment where a job posting receives hundreds of applications, using these models to filter out candidates who wouldn't fit the role would result in better outcomes than incompetent, junior talent acquisition specialists.

So, the sun is shining, the birds are singing, and AI is coming. Let's embrace it.
