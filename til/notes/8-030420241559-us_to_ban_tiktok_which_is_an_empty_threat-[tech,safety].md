Congress passed a bill to ban tiktok which seems like an empty threat. First of all, it's against freedom of speech which would make bill subject to judical review. If you combine this with Tiktok is storing US data in Oracle's servers, it's not clear how Congress can validate their reasoning. 

Additionally, the law itself is unenforcable. It would prevent TikTok to be distributed in US but it wouldn't prevent people to use it. 

Last but not least, it doesn't solve the actual problem which is that China is gathering sensitive data from US citizens. Congress ignores that most of tech companies collect these data and sells them through data brokers. Furthermore, the data collected by Tiktok is not that sensitive. It's more about social media usage, location data etc.

So, it seems like the proposed ban is rather a economical move to force owner company(ByteDance) to sell it to US owners.
