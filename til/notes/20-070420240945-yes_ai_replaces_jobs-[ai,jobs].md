From the dawn of the computer revolution, we've lacked a method to analyze how technology affects employment. Finally, we've developed a successful approach. Sadly, it clearly shows that since 1980, technology has been replacing jobs.

> The study uses new methods to examine how many jobs have been lost to machine automation and how many have been generated through “augmentation,” in which technology creates new tasks. On net, the study finds, and particularly since 1980, technology has replaced more U.S. jobs than it has generated.

They use a new method where they compare US Patent Office data with U.S. Census data, and the findings are interesting.

Around 1940-1980, technology was automating existing jobs but also creating new ones. For example, elevator and telephone operators, typesetters, carpenters, and machinists were automated by machines, but at the same time, shipping clerks, engineers, and department heads were created. After 1980, it seems like automation started to harm employment.

There are also interesting findings within the study where authors explain that, with the advancement of automation, middle-skill jobs are disappearing, leaving only low-skill and high-skill work. Additionally, they found out that large-scale consumer demand drives technological innovation, rather than entrepreneurs thinking out of the box.

According to the authors, this time it's different because AI can be used to replace some high-skill works and also act as a complement to decision-making skills. Therefore, it's challenging to predict the future of employment at this point.

I see most of the people are pretty optimistic about the future of employment. The main argument is usually technology creates new jobs. And, I remember the same argument was made against the book from Harvard professor Martin Ford, "Rise of the Robots", in which he argues most of the jobs are at risk of being automated. To be honest, I'm more pessimistic on this subject. I believe one way or another, most of the jobs that require humans to use computers are at risk of being automated by these new AI technologies. When it comes to the factory floor, it's just a matter of time...
