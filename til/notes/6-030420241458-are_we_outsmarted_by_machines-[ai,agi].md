Since 1960's we've been discussing about machines that can outperform human capabilities. And, most of the predictions were wrong. But, 2022 with the advancements in LLM modals, the debate heated up again.

Especially, given the [scaling laws for neural language models](https://openai.com/research/scaling-laws-for-neural-language-models), some CEO's like Sam Altman, Dario Amaradei thinks that in the next 5 years, we'll have AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) which can outperform human at any cognitive task.

On the other hand, AI experts that are asked about when high-level intelligence machine will come, their predictions seemed to be updated from 2060 to 2047 in one year. There're a lot of uncertainties in the field. And, also people like Tetlock warns us that expert forecasts are usually wrong as history shows.

On the other hand, Hubert Deyfus actually thinks that interpreting current methodologies as evidence of AGI is like seeing first monkey climbed a tree as evidence of a moon landing. So, a little bit of skepticism is needed.

However, most of the people agree that around 2030 AI systems will be able to do individual tasks better humans. For example, experts predict that first best-seller book will be written by a machine around 2029. And, around 2028, AI will hit top 40 in the music charts.

On philosophical side, definition of intelligence and how current AI systems fit into that definition might be a still big debate. However, for mere mortals like us, all of these technologies already outperformed us in many ways. They can write code, write articles, play games, drive cars better than us. For people, they're already smart whether they have human-level intelligence is a academic question rather than practical one. 

I think most important question for us at this point is what would be the impact of these new technologies on our lives and how we can prevent them from being used in a harmful and descructive way.
