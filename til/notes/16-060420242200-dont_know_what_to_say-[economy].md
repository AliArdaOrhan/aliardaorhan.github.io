![Homeless guys beats helpers](./homeless-beating.png)

Haha, don't know what to feel to be honest. A nice guy who helps homeless person by giving his own clothes gets beaten by the homeless person. It's dark, I know. But, at the same time leaving all those people without access to education, healthcare, shelter, food and so on is signature of American capitalism. So, you reap what you sow√∂ huh?
