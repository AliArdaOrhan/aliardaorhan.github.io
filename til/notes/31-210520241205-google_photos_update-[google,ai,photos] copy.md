Google Photos is receiving a huge update and Gemini will be integrated into it for better searches. We'll be able to query all photos with natural lnaguage like "list me the last 10 countries that I've visited" or "list me photos of people with the most photos" etc.

I think this is a clear example of how LLM models will be integrated into almost every app. One way or another, they'll be our primary interface for interacting with digital world. And, it's not a promise, it's here. Exciting times...
