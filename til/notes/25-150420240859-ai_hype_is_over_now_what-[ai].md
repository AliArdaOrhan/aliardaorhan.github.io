Seems like fun is over. 

People seems they're sturggling to find new ways to increase their productivity with tooling, startups are shutting down, and rest are struggling to keep their valuation high. On the other hand, the general public knows about ChatGPT but nothing else.

And, interesting figure is companies spent over 50B on NVIDIA chips but created 3B in return. That's a big number.

How should we interpret this?

One way or another every technology goes through this cycle. AI is no different. First it grabs a lot of attention than it can feed back into its own development. Then, it goes through a period of disillusionment. And, finally it finds its place in the market.

It seems like we're at the brink of disillusionment step. However, AI revolution is real deal. Compare it with old technologies like internet, electricity, and steam engine. They went through same cycles. At some point, people thought [internet might be overrated.](https://archive.is/EDvpU)

>A winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, Paul Krugman wrote in 1998, “The growth of the Internet will slow drastically, as the flaw in ‘Metcalfe’s law’—which states that the number of potential connections in a network is proportional to the square of the number of participants—becomes apparent: most people have nothing to say to each other! By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet’s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine’s.”

After a period of time and thanks to other innovations in the field, they became the backbone of our society. I don't think it'll be different for AI. It's just a matter of stable time.
