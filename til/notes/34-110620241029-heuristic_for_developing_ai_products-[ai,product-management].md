How're we going to build new AI applications? Nowadays, it's one of the most popular questions in the tech industry as the LLM models are all the rage. Don't get me wrong, it's not that straightforward as it seems as models are still hallucinating. Therefore the question of how much we can be sure about the correctness of the outputs that model producing?

[I've came across an article from Ben Evans](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2024/6/8/building-ai-products), poplar blogger. He argues that for building AI products we have 2 different paths in front of us.

One of them is narrowing UI for specific tasks. In this way, a general purpose tool is narrowed down a specific use case and all prompts are built in the interface as buttons, sliders or whatever you can think of. This very heuristic can be used to explain latest boom in coding assistants, marketing toos, knowledge management tools etc.

However, what Ben argues more importantly is using these general purpose technologies to build new application which he calls platform-native. For example, Instagram utilised smartphone's, let's call it platform in this case, cameras and computing resources to come up with a native photo-sharing experience. So, basically capabilities of the platform is hid behind the application and invisible to the user.

That's the heuristic Ben's applying to new type of applications where basic capabilities of platform are hid from users and error-rate is reduced to something ignorable. 

I also believe that'll be the path to build technologies that will have transformative effect on our society. Any other addition done to applications like Slack, Email, Zoom etc. are just incremental ones which are nice but won't be impactful as the hype suggests.
