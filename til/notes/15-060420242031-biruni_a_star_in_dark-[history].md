![Biruni](/biruni.webp)

I'm researching central asia history around 10th century. It's brilliant place where trade, science, high-culture and wars met. And, after the collapse of Christian culture, it became one of the most important hub for knowledge and grew a lot of bright minds. Biruni was one of them.

He was borned at 938 at Khwarezm region which is now in Uzbekistan. He spent his first 20 years around that region and studied many different fields suchg as islamic theology, mathemetics, astronomy, medicine and philisophoy. 

After Samani empire started to lose power, he left his home and moved to Bukhara in which he met with the one of greatest mind of Central asia Ibn Sina (Avicenna). Just to note, Ibn Sina wrote one of most famous book in medicine "Canon of Medicine" which was used in European's universities until 17th century.

With raise of Ghaznavid empire, he was **taken** to the Ghazni alongside with many researchers. Interestingly, Ghaznavid empire brought strict despotism to the region, contrary to his predecessors model of trade-centric autocracies. In short, It represents a downward trend in the region which used to be defined by trade, multi-culturalism, science and art. 

Their leader, ex-slave Mahmud of Ghazni was very rigid sunni muslim and tolerance was not in his dictionary. He waged a war against shia muslims, hindus, zoroastrians and buddhists. He destroyed many temples, libraries and killed thousands of people. Particularly with India raids, he accumulated unbelieveable amount of wealth by looting and imposing high taxes on non-muslims which became some sort of tradition that used by Ottomans until 19th century. But, portraying him as blood-thirsty tyrant would be unfair. At the end, he used that accumulated wealth to build most beautiful architectural pieces and patroned many poets and artists. Although, their only goal was to be sycophants and praise him.

One thing Mahmud did well was bringing bright people to Ghazni as war booty. And, Biruni was one of them. He went to Ghazni with his own will and spent his brightest 30 years there. 

Biruni was into Indian philosophy and science. And, Mahmud's raids opened a door for muslim scholars and Biruni opened that door completely. He spent 13 years in India and traveled different locations. As a result, he wrote 160 books and 20 tract. Although, his all works are not survived, some of them are very important.

- He succesfully calculated and noted latitude and longitude of cities he visited in India. He did this calculations by using methods from two of greatest mathematician of that era Harezmi and Ebu Nasr Mansur bin Irak. 
- He investigated minerals, jeological layers and fossils in India and opened the door for the idea that the world might have not been created as it is and possibly it has been evolved through time, which was an important finding for the era because it's basically against the basic islamic theology.
- Another striking finding was that he made very accurate calculations about the size of celestial bodies and earth. He calculated the diameter of earth by 16.8 km of its actual value. These results and calculations couldn't be surpassed for 600 years. Later, he calculated a length of a meridian circle and he was only 620 meter away from the actual value. Incredible, innit?


Only with these findings, he earned his place in history. But, what made him unique was his time spent in India where he came up with a book called **Tahqiq ma li'l-Hind (Researches on India)** which is a comprehensive book about India's culture, international relations, religion, history of thought and philosophy. To complete it, Biruni learned sanskrit and studied the work of many different scholars in the region. But, as he lived in a time where Mahmud's religious intolerance was at its peak, he used cautious language. He appraised Indian science and philosophy, but he criticized their scientist and philosophers.

No matter what, the book is still considered as one of the greatest achievements of Islamic scholoars. And, what significant about this marvelous book is that it rejects all old geometric methods that used before to describe another culture and invented a methods to crystallize the differences between cultures which called comparative studies today. In it, he compares different indian approaches to technological problems and compares them with central asian ones. He also invented a taxonomy to classify different indian poems by their meter and rhyme and represented his findings in a table as we can expect from a modern scholor.

Moreover, according to his view, Empirical evidences can't be comprimised and always beats oral traditions. As a matter of fact, with this view he criticized Buhari's hadiths and if you consider that hadiths are second most important source of islamic theology, you can understand how serious he was about empiricism. Bold move for that time.
