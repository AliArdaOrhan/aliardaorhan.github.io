![Xi Jinping](/xi-jinping.jpeg)

Same old Economist magazine, same old story. Look how confident they're given their historical record of failed forecasts about China. And yet again, they've just predicted another doom scenario. haha ðŸ¤£

Anyways, China seems to respond global economic stagnation by boosting invesments in high-tech industries. They represent this strategy as unleashing new productive forces. And, given that China's property industry was in a bubble and at last it bursted. To come out of it, Xi Jinping seems like leaning over high-productivity and envisions high-tech revolution within the country.

The scale is incredible...China will spend at least 1.6 trillion dollars in 2024. Almost equals to the half of the invesments in the US. 

It's very interesting because Xi Jinping takes very different route than West has been resorted to, which is stimulating consumers by injecting more money into system. Instead, China is focusing on creating works rather money. Although, it sounds like a good strategy, it's risky as it's not tested before.

Clearly, motivations of Xi Jinping can be understandable. We're not living free-trading 2000's any more. And, in this protectionist age, China is preparing its young population to a struggle with USA. And, obviously, whoever wins White House this year, there'll be more tariffs and sanctions on Chinese goods.

However, given the track record of China, there's no reason to believe that they can't pull it off. Therefore, I wouldn't bet against China tbh.
