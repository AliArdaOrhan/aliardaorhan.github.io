Wow, the second wave of layoffs took its tool on Tesla. After the company announced their deliveries this year fell %8, it seems like they're trying to cut costs to keep the company competitive enough with Chinese EV manufacturers.

The year has started with big-tech layoffs, and although we didn't expect this it looks like [70000 employees are already laid off until now.]((https://layoffs.fyi/)) I'm not sure where it goes but I'm pretty sure we were already over-staffed and it was necessary to some extend. But, I'll honest last year and this year, the combined number is reached 180k. That's a lot of people.
