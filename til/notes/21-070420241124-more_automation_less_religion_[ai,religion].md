![AI vs Religion](./automation-vs-religion.png)


Came across an interesting research that shows with exposure to automation, robots, and AI, people tend to become less religious. It's very counterintuitive, isn't it? I mean, I always thought that with more free time, people would be more likely to spend time on their religious activities. But it seems like it's not the case.

Maybe it shows the shortcomings of existing religions in the modern world. In the end, they're products of their time. And they're designed to control and manage people of that time when science was in its infancy. Interestingly enough, the article also touches on Max Weber's view of science. He once said that science is the "disenchantment of the world," in other words, science replaces supernatural explanations with rational and empirical ones.

But as researchers also stated, it didn't work well in the past, did it? Positivism of french lost, religion continued. And in some cases, it actually thrived. As a 100% atheist, that's reason I find this research very intriguing. Can the high-tech revolution nail the coffin of religion? Or will they change into something else? Who knows...

However, I'm very happy to see that the number of Americans who believe their belonging to a church decreased from 70 percent in 1990 to 47 percent in 2020. In the end, nobody in the world wants a superpower run by religious zealots. It's dangerous... Just remind yourself of the Iraq war.
