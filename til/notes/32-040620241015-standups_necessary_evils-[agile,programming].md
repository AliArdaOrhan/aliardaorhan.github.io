I've came across a blog article that smashes the idea of daily standups. The author argues that most of the standups are rubbish and not useful from the **software engineering** perspective and criticizes the role of scrum masters and stakeholders in the meeting as they usually don't allow developers to discuss the real technical problems they're facing. 

Although, I'm working for a company which internalized the agile principles and practices, I can't say that I'm a big fan of standups. Most of the times I forget what has been discussed after 5 minutes. To be honest, most of the developers don't know how to update their peers in a concise and productive way. Most of the time what you hear is over-detailed explanation about the situation where you don't have enough context to address it. Therefore, it turns into a monologue where only the speaker is interested.

In terms of status updates, I can easily say that it can be tracked via Jira board. I personally don't see any value in hearing "I've worked on this task and I'm still working on it" every single day. As our team utilizes pair-programming practices everybad, it's very common to hear second engineer to say "I'm doing same thing as my pair" which is, you'll appreciate as well, not very useful.

And also, I can feel the pain of author when it comes stakeholders and scrum masters. We currently don't have any of those roles in our team but I know how frustrating it is when bunch of people who doesn't understand delicate details of software engineering cut you off when software engineers trying to explain the problem they're facing. My gut reaction is always "WTF??? Can you let me finish my sentence and let us to discuss the problem?".

But, I think agile sailboat has already sailed and it's almost impossible to stop its worshippers. I haven't seen any single company that has abondoned daily standups just because a couple of people think it's not useful. Actually, even it's proved that worshippers won't be changing their mind and, you know, sadly people always find a way to justify their beliefs.

Therefoere, I have a couple of things to make standups more efficient:

- Check the pulse, if team also thinks standups take too much time or inefficient, then you have an oppurtunity to optimize. Otherwise, I wouldn't suggest to touch it. It'll backfire and it'll be weary to convince people to change their precious-but-not-productive habits.
- If you can, get daily updates in written form. Something in Jira or GDoc would work. Every developer can write what they're working on and whether there's any blocker. This way, the progress can be tracked from a single source and it'll be easier to understand trends.
- Otherwise, be concise and productive. Have discussions about the problems team's facing at the end of meeting where you can get people a chance to leave meeting. In this way, people won't be in a position that they need to listen something irrelevant for them. 
- Be serious about 15 minutes. If you apply third priniple, your standups will definitely be shorter as it was before. Don't let it slip. Be serious and stubborn about it and any discussion you feel like it's going to extend, postpone it to the end of meeting.


If you follow these 4 simple principles, you'll be able to have very productive and concise standups. Please don't forget that the main goal of standups is to update your peers about your progress and to discuss the problems you're facing. **It's not for problem solving.**
