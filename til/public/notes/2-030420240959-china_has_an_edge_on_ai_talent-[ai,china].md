I've just read a blog post about how China is leading on AI talent. Appearently, China is leading world on producing AI talents. And specifically, it's not just in China also in United States, Chinese people becoming increasingly more dominant in AI field.

According to the research, Chinese researches **make up 38 percent of the top AI researches in the United States** at the moment. The number was **27 compared to 3 years** before. Currently, **Americans make up for 37 percent and it was 31 percent 3 years before.**

Interestingly, China is more focused on manufacturing capabilities rather than digital technologies like ChatGPT etc.

And also, with the latest development in law system, some chinese researchers are prosecuted for sharing their research with the Chinese goverment. 

As a result, more chinese researchers tend to stay in China rather than migrating to United States. It might have impact on competitiveness of United States in AI field. But, more interestingly it clearly shows that China is ahead of United States in talent-growing. It'll have important impact.
